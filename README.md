## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- A web server (Apache, Nginx, or any local development server)
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Quick Start
1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Start a local web server** in the project directory:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
4. **Access the dashboard** at `http://localhost:8000/src/main/resources/templates/dashboard.ftlh`

### Alternative Setup (Direct File Access)
If you don't have a web server, you can open the files directly:
1. Navigate to `src/main/resources/templates/`
2. Open `dashboard.ftlh` in your web browser
3. Note: Some features may not work properly due to CORS restrictions
